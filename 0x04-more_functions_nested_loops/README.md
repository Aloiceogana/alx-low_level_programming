c - more functions, more nested loops

2 - write a function that checks for a digit (o through 9)



3 - write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line

4 - write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line

5 - write a function that prints 10x the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

6 - write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

7 - write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8 - write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

9 - fizz-buzz - write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. but for mutiples of 3 print fiz: the nimber and for the multiples of five print buzz. for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
